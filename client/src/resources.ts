    description:
      "Spiders often have a bad reputation. But photographer Javier Aznar shows how the arachnids can be beautiful, unique, and even charming—like this bromeliad spider perched on a banana flower in Ecuador.",

    title: "Mountain Hares",
    description:
      "Mountain hares in the Scottish Highlands have evolved to fit their surroundings—but as climate change ushers in varying weather, these animals stand out more often against a dark, snowless landscape, possibly leaving them vulnerable to predators.",

    title: "Orcas",
    description:
      "These orcas have mastered a hunting technique called “wave washing”: In unison, the orcas turn water in a weapon, swimming fast and creating waves that crack the ice upon which a Weddell seal rests. When the seal falls into the water, the predators feast.",

    title: "Dorylus Mayri Ant",
    description:
      "Inspired by his daughte's curiosity, photographer Eduard Florin Niga documented the tiny yet fascinating world of ants up close. With fossil records that indicate ants have been around for up to 168 million years, they're one of the planet's most abundant and successful animals, as seen in this Dorylus mayri ant from West Africa.",

    title: "Asian Elephant",
    description:
      "An Asian elephant steps over an electric fence on a moonlit night at the edge of Sri Lanka's Kaudulla National Park. Though the island has nearly 3,000 miles of  fencing, elephants often outsmart it, for example using their trunks to push trees onto the fences. The endangered species are increasingly squeezed into small habitats within Southeast Asia, and humans and elephants have an uneasy coexistence.",

    title: "Florida Manatees",
    description:
      "Florida manatees are beloved, and their peaceful demeanor has been critical to the subspecies’ success. Conservationists have helped them rebound from under a thousand individuals in the 1960s to more than 7,500 about six years ago—but recent die-offs have troubled conservationists, according to our January story. Above, manatees gather on a sandy bottom near Homosassa Springs, where the water is warm in winter.",
