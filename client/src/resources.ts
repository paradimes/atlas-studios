    title: "ORCAS",
    description:
      "These orcas have mastered a hunting technique called “wave washing”: In unison, the orcas turn water in a weapon, swimming fast and creating waves that crack the ice upon which a Weddell seal rests. When the seal falls into the water, the predators feast.",

The endangered species are increasingly squeezed into small habitats within Southeast Asia, and humans and elephants have an uneasy coexistence.",
